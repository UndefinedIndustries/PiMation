# PiMation
The Pi Home Auto Mation suite. This project is where all of the modules 
that I have build for my home automation system (HAS) will go.  If the 
module is big enough, and I care enough about it (sPrInkler) it will get 
its own repository.  However, if it is super small and simple, I will 
not make a seperate repository for the module (for example, the garage 
module), unless if requested.  Have fun, remember to post issues, and 
enjoy!
